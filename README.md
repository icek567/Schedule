# Schedule
Homework 5 was to build a day schedule in that follows your day in a regular 8 hour time frame. The concept was that you are able to write whatever task that needs to be completed and then be able to save it. Once saved, you can refresh the page and the task will still be saved there. The main frame of the page is made of javascript with some help of styling and HTML. To save the information you would connect the “save” button with the localStorage. The other aspect of this was to make the Schedule move along with the day as in you would not be able to have access to the morning events once it was past time. This one something that I didn't really get a chance to complete since I was not 100% sure on how to accomplish this.
